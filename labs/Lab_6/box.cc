// I am sorry that this is very had to follow, but basically the code buids each
// layer in a grid pattern, but that requires two different loops, one where the
// y increases for every x and one where the x increases for every y. This
// creates the grid pattern. This is done all the way up to the given thickness
// where the box should start to hollow out. At that point the function still
// creates the grid the same way, but just avoids filling in the center of the
// box and creates a wall based on the given thickness by ignoring the center
// when filling it in. This can be seen with test.gcode file. *Helps to see the
// open top box if rapid movement and toolpath points are turned off in the
// settings at the bottom*
